Hello
Thank you for trying d77void RiverWM edition.


## Installer

To install with Calamares:

```
su

calamares
```

To run the tui installer just open a terminal and type:

```
sudo d77void-installer
```

Note: 

To maintain the configuration of the live iso, during install, choose local instead of network install.

During install, add your user to the storage group. That way udiskie will automount disks.


## Keybinds

super + shift + return -> terminal

super + shift + e -> logout

super + q -> close window

super + d -> menu1

super + m -> mail

super + n -> menu2

super + o -> gmrun

super + t -> lock

super + w -> web browser

super + x -> powermenu

super + shift + f -> file manager


# River Tweaks

To alter the autostart programs, add/swap keybinds and keyboard layout configure ~/.config/river/init ; the file is self explanatory and with several examples already configured.

Have fun!
